When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	When you are collaborating with others, or when dealing with a large file.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up to date with your remote repository?

	Because you want to know always what files you are pulling to your machine, and not get confused with auto updates to local 'test' files.
